Welcome to the 2nd iteration of our text-based Plants vs. Zombies game!

Check out the user's guide for getting started and learning to play. On-screen instructions are also provided to help you.

Authors and their contributions:

Abdillahi Nur: Worked on implementing Zombie, PeaShooter and Zombie logic from iteration one into the GUI. Ensured GameOver and NextTurn logic worked correctly and was implemented accordingly. Wrote the documentation file detailing our design decisions.

Paul Roode : UML class and sequence diagrams; some class architecting and refactoring; added/modified most of the Javadoc comments; generated API documentation; significantly de-smelled code; reformatted all code to ensure consistency; changed variable/method names to ensure all naming follows convention; added/modified/optimized various methods and code segments (e.g., added switches, error catching, etc.); finalized design decision justification document

Jacob Laboissonniere: Worked on inital game model classes (world, level, actor subclasses). Wrote USERMANUAL.md. Created GUI fxml file and GUIController class and integrated with existing model. Number of small changes to clean up code.

Sameed Mohammed: Worked on PeaShooter and Sunflower class and its implementation in CommandProcessor.  Also worked on nextTurn logic in the CommandProcessor Class. Worked on documentation describing some of our design choices.
